While on the surface this seems great, the reality is that many of these technologies are riddled with syntax quirks, incomplete documentation and a high barrier to entry.In this talk, we’ll discuss why truly intuitive tooling doesn’t exist, go over some common misconceptions in the React community and learn more inclusive ways to talk about emerging frontend technologies.',

Changing margins is done by typing, changing font styles is done by typing, and every change often requires you to wait a while before you can see the result.During this talk I want to explore how we can make our development tooling more visually oriented. What can we do to lower the feedback loop and make it easier to create beautiful websites and apps?',

          description: 'Done well, open source is one of the highest-value targets for businesses these days. Companies like Facebook and Airbnb leverage OSS as a source of brand equity and recruiting, among other advantages. However, OSS is still uncomfortable for many companies — and even if they do open source their tools, these projects often fail to launch — because they’re missing the most important (and best) part of OSS: the community.Projects that survive in today’s landscape have thriving communities that care deeply about the quality and advancement of open source and the people using it. But open source can also be intimidating to newcomers, and occasionally unwelcoming. In this talk, learn how popular open source framework Gatsby has doubled down on community, including: 1. Offering open pair programming hours 2. Trusting all contributors with merge access 3. Sending free swag to contributors... And much more! Learn how you can borrow our strategies to create a healthy, welcoming community for your open source projects, starting today!',
