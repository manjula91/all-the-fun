                                <p> 
                                This is a hands-on workshop for developers in which you will learn how to define a common language for collaboration and iterate on products faster.<br/>
                                Learn the best practices of component driven design and how to standardize your design patterns. Leverage React to build a component library that can be used in products and can evolve as teams use it. At the end of the day, you will have a small but complete Design system implementation that will cover the full product lifecycle.

                                <p> 
                                Reason lets you write simple, fast and quality type safe code while leveraging both the JavaScript & OCaml ecosystems. In this workshop we won't only see how and why we should write our code in ReasonML, but talk about practical applications of using ReasonML in new or existing React projects
                                </p>

                                Good JavaScript and React knowledge, open minded, basic functional programming concepts in any programming language is a bonus.

                                ReasonML core syntax, Bucklescript and interop with existing JavaScript packages, ReasonReact, Reason and GraphQL.<br/>
                                During this workshop we will build a working ReasonReact app with GraphQL backend. We will also add JavaScript npm packages and interop between them and our Reason React app. For final touch we will discuss how to embed our ReasonReact app as part of bigger existing React application.
